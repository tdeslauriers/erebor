# Erebor

**Description:** A learning project to rebuild the Gateway service that provides main entrance to family website's restricted content. New service will incorporate mTls connections, explict Oauth 2 flow, and core website service coordination.

- I am also using it as a POC to help test and develop the library/package content for my [carapace](https://github.com/tdeslauriers/carapace) project.

**Name:** _Erebor is the actual name of the Lonely Mountain from J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit. It is where Smaug is sitting on his mound of treasure -> this gateway will give access to the site's restricted content. Also, in the story, Erebor had a Great Main Gate so I thought it apropro._
